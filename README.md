[![Home Assistant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Home%20Assistant-2024.8.0+-blue.svg)](https://www.home-assistant.io/)
[![Blueprint](https://img.shields.io/badge/Blueprint-YAML-orange.svg)](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/using_blueprints/)

A powerful and safe Home Assistant blueprint that automatically updates Home Assistant Core, OS, add-ons, and integrations on a scheduled basis with intelligent safety features.

## üéâ Latest Update - v2025.10.8

**Enhanced Backup Detection:**
- **Event-Driven Monitoring:** Switched from polling to event-driven backup detection for faster and more reliable completion detection
- **New Backup Service:** Using `backup.create_automatic` instead of `hassio.backup_full` for improved compatibility with HA's native backup system
- **Dual Trigger System:**
  - Primary: Monitors `sensor.backup_backup_manager_state` transition (create_backup ‚Üí idle)
  - Fallback: Monitors `sensor.backup_last_successful_automatic_backup` updates
- **Better Diagnostics:** Logs backup duration and detection method used
- **No More Polling Delays:** Instant detection when backup completes, no unnecessary waiting
- **Deprecated:** `backup_location` input (now uses HA's configured backup location)

**Impact:** Backups are detected as soon as they complete, reducing automation run time and eliminating false timeout warnings. See changelog for full details.

## Previous Update - v2025.10.7

**Critical Bug Fixes:**
- **What-If Mode:** Fixed issue where What-If mode was still creating actual backups and waiting for completion. What-If mode now properly skips all backup operations and immediately continues to update simulation.
- **Backup Monitoring:** Enhanced backup completion detection with fallback methods (idle state check) to reduce false timeouts.
- **Notifications:** Added `[WHAT-IF MODE]` prefix to all relevant notifications throughout the automation for better clarity.
- **Logging:** Improved backup timeout messages to indicate the backup may still be running in the background.

**Impact:** What-If mode now works as a true dry run without creating backups or making any changes. Backup monitoring is more reliable. All notifications clearly indicate What-If mode status. See [CHANGELOG_v2025.10.7.md](changelogs/CHANGELOG_v2025.10.7.md) for full details.

- ‚úÖ Breaking changes are skipped automatically

#### If You Want All Updates Applied (Including Breaking Changes)

Add this to your automation configuration:
```yaml
skip_breaking_changes: false
```

### From Earlier Versions

All changes maintain backward compatibility except for the `skip_breaking_changes` default value change. Existing automations will continue to work but may start skipping updates with breaking changes.

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

- `update_process_started_entity`: Not configured
- `backup_bool`: true
- `skip_breaking_changes`: true

**Expected:**
- ‚úÖ Backup is created
- ‚úÖ Update with breaking changes is skipped
- ‚úÖ Notification sent about skipped update

### Scenario 2: With Helper Entity + Normal Updates
**Setup:**
- `update_process_started_entity`: Configured, state is 'off'
- `backup_bool`: true
- Update available without breaking changes

**Expected:**
- ‚úÖ Backup is created
- ‚úÖ Helper entity set to 'on'
- ‚úÖ Update is applied normally

### Scenario 3: Person Not Home
**Setup:**
- `person_home_entity`: Configured
- Person is away

**Expected:**
- ‚úÖ Updates are skipped
- ‚úÖ Mobile notification sent (if enabled)
- ‚úÖ Automation exits gracefully

### Scenario 4: What-If Mode Testing
**Setup:**
- `whatif_mode`: true
- `backup_bool`: true
- `skip_breaking_changes`: true
- Multiple updates available (some with breaking changes)
- Mobile notifications enabled

**Expected:**
- ‚úÖ No backup is created (but log shows it would be)
- ‚úÖ No updates are installed (but log shows what would be)
- ‚úÖ Updates with breaking changes shown as "would be skipped"
- ‚úÖ Regular updates shown as "would be updated"
- ‚úÖ No system restart occurs (but log shows it would if needed)
- ‚úÖ Notifications show "[WHAT-IF]" prefix
- ‚úÖ Summary shows what would happen without making changes

- [changelogs/](changelogs/) - Version changelogs and release notes

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

1. **Start Conservative:** Use the default safe settings initially
2. **Test First:** Use What-If mode (`whatif_mode: true`) to safely test your configuration before production
3. **Validate Configuration:** Run the automation in What-If mode to see what would be updated and skipped
4. **Enable Notifications:** Stay informed about update activities
5. **Review Logs:** Check Home Assistant logbook after automation runs
6. **Have Backups:** Always maintain external backups beyond the automation's built-in backup
7. **Monitor Breaking Changes:** Review what updates were skipped and apply manually when ready
8. **Use Helper Entity:** For better control and resume functionality
9. **Schedule Wisely:** Choose low-usage time windows for updates

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

- Breaking changes detection relies on keywords in release notes
- Some updates may not include proper release notes
- Network interruptions during updates can cause issues
- Restart timing may vary depending on system performance
- Mobile notifications sent 15 seconds before reboot may not always deliver in time on slower networks
