# Changelog v2025.10.6

## Summary
This release fixes a critical bug where backups were not being created even when `backup_bool` was set to `true`. The issue was caused by the helper entity being set to 'on' too early in the automation flow, which prevented the backup creation condition from passing.

## üêõ Critical Bug Fix

### Fix: Backup Not Created Due to Helper Entity Timing Issue

**Issue:** When the `update_process_started_entity` (helper entity) was configured, backups were not being created even though `backup_bool` was set to `true`. This occurred regardless of the `max_backup_age` setting.

**Root Cause:** 
The helper entity was being set to 'on' too early in the automation sequence (line 1017-1026), before the backup creation check. The backup creation logic then checked if the helper entity was in state 'off' (line 1114-1115) to determine if a backup should be created. Since the helper had just been set to 'on', this condition failed, preventing the backup from being created.

**Problematic Flow:**
1. Line 1024: Helper entity set to 'on' (when schedule is 'on' and helper is configured)
2. Line 1108-1116: Backup creation condition checks if helper is 'off' OR not configured
3. Since helper was just set to 'on', condition fails
4. Backup is NOT created ‚ùå
5. Updates proceed without backup ‚ùå

**Fix:**
Removed the early helper entity setting (lines 1017-1026). The helper entity should only be set to 'on' AFTER the backup is created, which is already correctly handled inside the backup creation block (line 1121).

**Correct Flow After Fix:**
1. Backup creation condition checks if helper is 'off' OR not configured ‚úÖ
2. If condition passes: Create backup
3. AFTER backup starts: Set helper to 'on' (line 1121) ‚úÖ
4. Updates proceed with backup created ‚úÖ

**Impact:** 
- ‚úÖ Backups will now be created correctly when `backup_bool` is true
- ‚úÖ Helper entity timing is now correct - set to 'on' only after backup creation begins
- ‚úÖ No configuration changes required
- ‚úÖ Works correctly with or without helper entity configured

**Related Issues:**
- This bug was introduced when the helper entity logic was added/modified
- The helper entity is used to track whether backups have been created for resume-after-restart scenarios
- The early setting was likely intended to mark the update process as started, but it interfered with the backup creation logic

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Scenario 1: With Helper Entity Configured

**Setup:**
- Configure `update_process_started_entity` with an `input_boolean` helper
- Ensure helper entity is in 'off' state
- Set `backup_bool: true`
- Set `max_backup_age: 0` (disabled)
- Have updates available

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Backup should be created
- ‚úÖ Helper entity should be set to 'on' AFTER backup creation begins
- ‚úÖ Updates should proceed normally
- ‚úÖ Helper entity should be set to 'off' after updates complete

### Test Scenario 2: Without Helper Entity Configured

**Setup:**
- Don't configure `update_process_started_entity` (leave empty)
- Set `backup_bool: true`
- Have updates available

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Backup should be created
- ‚úÖ Updates should proceed normally
- ‚úÖ No errors related to helper entity

### Test Scenario 3: Resume After Restart (Helper Entity Already 'on')

**Setup:**
- Configure `update_process_started_entity`
- Manually set helper entity to 'on' state (simulating a resume scenario)
- Set `backup_bool: true`
- Have updates available

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Backup should be SKIPPED (already created in previous run)
- ‚úÖ Updates should proceed normally
- ‚úÖ This demonstrates the helper entity is working correctly for resume scenarios

### Test Scenario 4: With max_backup_age Enabled

**Setup:**
- Configure `update_process_started_entity`
- Ensure helper entity is in 'off' state
- Set `backup_bool: true`
- Set `max_backup_age` to a non-zero value (e.g., 1 day)
- Ensure a recent backup exists
- Have updates available

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Backup age check should pass (recent backup exists)
- ‚úÖ Backup should be created
- ‚úÖ Updates should proceed normally

## Migration Guide

No migration required! This is a pure bug fix that corrects the automation behavior to work as originally intended.

If you previously worked around this issue by:
- Disabling the helper entity
- Manually triggering backups
- Or any other workaround

You can now remove those workarounds and use the automation as designed.

## Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Fully backward compatible
- ‚úÖ No configuration changes needed
- ‚úÖ Existing automations will now work correctly
- ‚úÖ No changes to input definitions or external APIs

## Files Modified

- `auto_update_scheduled.yaml` - Removed lines 1017-1026 (early helper entity setting)
- `changelogs/CHANGELOG_v2025.10.6.md` - This changelog (new)

## Technical Details

### Line Changes

**Removed (lines 1017-1026):**
```yaml
- alias: Set ON helper flag
  if:
    - '{{ input_update_process_started_entity | string | length > 0 }}'
    - condition: state
      entity_id: !input schedule_entity
      state: 'on'
  then:
    - action: input_boolean.turn_on
      target:
        entity_id: !input update_process_started_entity
```

**Kept (inside backup creation block, line ~1121):**
```yaml
- alias: "Set helper entity to ON (if configured)"
  if:
    - '{{ input_update_process_started_entity | string | length > 0 }}'
  then:
    - action: input_boolean.turn_on
      target:
        entity_id: "{{ input_update_process_started_entity }}"
      continue_on_error: true
```

### Why This Fix Works

The helper entity serves two purposes:
1. **Track backup creation**: Prevent duplicate backups in the same update window
2. **Enable resume after restart**: Allow automation to skip backup if resuming after a system restart

The timing of when the helper is set to 'on' is critical:
- ‚úÖ **Correct**: Set to 'on' AFTER backup creation begins (ensures backup is created first)
- ‚ùå **Incorrect**: Set to 'on' BEFORE backup check (prevents backup from being created)

The fix removes the early setting and relies on the existing correct setting inside the backup creation block.
