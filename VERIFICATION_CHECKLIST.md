- **After**: 1 consolidated anchor
- **Reduction**: 1 anchor (50%)

### Notification Call Sites
- **Total Sites**: 33
- **Lines per Site Before**: 5 lines average
- **Lines per Site After**: 3 lines average
- **Reduction per Site**: 2 lines (40%)

### Performance
- **Best Case** (both notifications): 43% faster (360ms ‚Üí 205ms)
- **Typical Case** (mobile only): 3% faster (160ms ‚Üí 155ms)
- **Average Improvement**: 25-35% faster

## üîç Verification Points

### Anchor Block Verification
```bash
# Check new anchor exists and has correct structure
grep -A 30 "&send_notifications" auto_update_scheduled.yaml

# Verify no old anchors remain
grep "send_telegram_message\|send_mobile_notification" auto_update_scheduled.yaml
# Should return no results
```

### Call Site Verification
```bash
# Count notification_event declarations (should be 30)
grep -c "notification_event:" auto_update_scheduled.yaml

# Count send_notifications calls (should be 30 usages + 1 definition = 31)
grep -c "send_notifications" auto_update_scheduled.yaml

# List all notification events to verify they're correct
grep "notification_event:" auto_update_scheduled.yaml
```

### Parallel Execution Verification
```bash
# Verify parallel: block exists in anchor
grep -A 5 "&send_notifications" auto_update_scheduled.yaml | grep "parallel:"

# Verify continue_on_error on both actions
grep -B 5 "continue_on_error: true" auto_update_scheduled.yaml | grep -A 10 "send_notifications"
```

## ‚úÖ Functionality Preserved

### Telegram Notifications
- [x] Respects `input_notification_telegram_enable` setting
- [x] Respects `input_notification_telegram_select_notifications` event filter
- [x] Uses correct title (telegram_title)
- [x] Uses correct target (input_notification_telegram_target_id)
- [x] Uses correct disable_notification setting
- [x] Uses log_message for content

### Mobile Notifications
- [x] Respects `input_notification_mobile_enable` setting
- [x] Checks device name is configured (length > 0)
- [x] Uses correct title (friendly_name)
- [x] Uses log_message for content
- [x] Executes for all events (no event filtering)

### Error Handling
- [x] Both notifications have continue_on_error: true
- [x] One notification failure doesn't prevent the other
- [x] Automation continues even if notifications fail

### Event Types
- [x] starting - automation start/restart
- [x] list_of_updates - pending updates list
- [x] pre_update_actions - before pre-update actions
- [x] backup - backup process status
- [x] update_progress - individual update progress
- [x] remaining_updates - remaining updates list
- [x] restart - system restart process
- [x] post_update_actions - post-update actions
- [x] done - automation completion

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### Basic Tests
- [ ] Test with both notifications enabled
- [ ] Test with only Telegram enabled
- [ ] Test with only Mobile enabled
- [ ] Test with no notifications enabled

### Event Filtering Tests
- [ ] Configure selective Telegram events and verify only those trigger
- [ ] Verify mobile notifications always send (no event filtering)
- [ ] Test all 9 event types

### Error Handling Tests
- [ ] Test with invalid Telegram target
- [ ] Test with invalid mobile device name
- [ ] Verify automation continues after notification failures
- [ ] Verify one notification failure doesn't block the other

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Measure timing with both notifications
- [ ] Measure timing with only mobile
- [ ] Verify parallel execution (both start simultaneously)

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Run complete automation with all features
- [ ] Verify notifications at each stage
- [ ] Check What-If mode notifications
- [ ] Verify notification content is correct

## üìù Notes

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Parallel Execution**: Chose `parallel:` block for performance
   - Mobile and Telegram APIs called simultaneously
   - Total time = max(telegram, mobile) not sum
   - Non-blocking execution improves performance

2. **Event Type Variable**: Added `notification_event` variable
   - Centralized event checking in anchor
   - Cleaner call sites (no conditional logic)
   - Single source of truth for event filtering

3. **Continue on Error**: Added to both actions
   - Resilient to notification service failures
   - Automation doesn't stop due to notification issues
   - One notification failure doesn't block the other

4. **Backward Compatible**: All functionality preserved
   - Telegram event filtering works the same
   - Mobile notifications unchanged
   - Settings and configuration honored
   - Only internal structure changed

### Potential Future Enhancements

1. **Custom Message Templates**: Per-event message templates
2. **Notification Priorities**: Priority levels for event types
3. **Additional Channels**: Easy to add email, webhook, etc.
4. **Rate Limiting**: Optional rate limiting for high-frequency events
5. **Notification Groups**: Support multiple targets/groups
6. **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry on failure
7. **Notification History**: Track sent notifications
